Provided are two csv(comma separated) files.

1. inv.csv
contains 4 columns namely, product name, container size, sku(product identifier) and price

2. upc.csv
contains 2 columns namely, sku(product identifier) and upc

The goal of this exercise is the following
1. to write up a script to join those two files on the sku column in either file, and generate a new csv with all columns in it. 
2. strip out the dollar sign($) from the price column.

Choose your language of choice, python, ruby or anything else, but what we would like to see is a programmatic script that we can use to test out and reprocess the files again.

This exercise should not take more than 2 hours.
